<!-- What is HTML?


HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
It's the standard markup language for creating the structure and content of web pages.



What is the purpose of the <doctype> declaration?
Tells the browser which version of HTML the page is written in (e.g., <!DOCTYPE html> for HTML5).


What are the main sections of an HTML document?
<head>: Contains meta-information about the page (title, character set, etc.)
<body>: Contains the visible content of the page.


What is the difference between block-level and inline elements?
Block-level:
Start on a new line.
Occupy the full width available.
Examples: <p>, <h1>, <div>, <ul>
Inline:
Do not start on a new line.
Only take up as much width as necessary.
Examples: <span>, <a>, <b>, <i>

Intermediate

What are semantic HTML elements and why are they important?
Elements that clearly describe their meaning and purpose (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <article>, <aside>).
Improve accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and code readability.



What is the difference between an id and a class attribute?
id: Unique identifier for a single element within the page.
class: Can be applied to multiple elements to style or group them together.


How do you create a form in HTML?
Use the <form> tag, along with various input elements like <input>, <textarea>, <select>, etc.


What is the purpose of the alt attribute in the <img> tag?
Provides alternative text for images that cannot be displayed (e.g., due to slow loading or browser issues).
Also important for accessibility (screen readers).


What are HTML entities?
Special characters represented by code sequences to avoid conflicts with HTML syntax (e.g., &nbsp; for a non-breaking space, &lt; for less than).
Advanced

What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?
XHTML is an XML-based version of HTML with stricter syntax rules.


What are some of the new features introduced in HTML5?
New semantic elements, canvas for 2D drawing, video and audio support, local storage, geolocation.


What is the role of the manifest file in HTML?
Used for offline web applications, allowing the browser to cache resources for offline access.


What is the difference between GET and POST methods in an HTML form?
GET: Appends form data to the URL, visible in the browser address bar. Limited data size.
POST: Sends data in the request body, not visible in the URL. Can handle larger amounts of data.


Explain the concept of responsive web design.
Designing websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).
Remember:

Practice: The best way to learn is by practicing. Create simple HTML pages and experiment with different elements and attributes.
Refer to the documentation: The official HTML documentation (e.g., MDN Web Docs) is a valuable resource for detailed information and examples.
I hope these questions are helpful! Let me know if you'd like more specific examples or want to focus on a particular area of HTML.

What is the purpose of the <canvas> element?

    Provides a 2D drawing surface for scripts (typically JavaScript) to draw graphics programmatically.
    Explain the role of the viewport meta tag.

    
    Controls the dimensions and scaling of the viewport (the user's visible area of the webpage) on mobile devices.
    What is the difference between sessionStorage and localStorage?
    
    sessionStorage: Data is stored only for the duration of the current browser session and is deleted when the browser is closed.
    localStorage: Data is stored persistently on the user's device and can be accessed by the webpage later, even after the browser is closed.
    What is the purpose of the manifest file?
    
    Used for offline web applications. It tells the browser which files to cache so that the application can work offline.
    How can you improve the accessibility of your HTML pages?
    
    Use semantic HTML elements.
    Provide alternative text for images (alt attribute).
    Use appropriate heading levels (<h1> to <h6>).
    Ensure sufficient color contrast.
    Add ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility.



    What is the difference between HTML and XML?
    
    HTML: Designed for displaying web pages.
    XML: Designed for data exchange and storage.
    XML is more strict in its syntax and case-sensitivity.
    What are some common security vulnerabilities in HTML and how can you mitigate them?
    
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Sanitize user input, use output encoding.
    Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Use tokens and proper HTTP methods.
    Injection Attacks: Validate and sanitize user input.
    Remember:
    
    Practical Application: The best way to solidify your understanding is to build real-world projects.
    Stay Updated: HTML is constantly evolving. Keep learning about new features and best practices.
