          fervopur all around . With the abrogation of Article 370 and a
          PEACEFUL EID in the country and in kashmir especially . It was enough
          reason for the centrol government to heave a sigh of relief . On
          Monday night ,when peaple feasted on the occasipon of EID ,entire
          india watched one thing ...in common...that's right ,PM Narendra
          Modi's Man vs Wild programme with bear grylls on discovery channel .
          shot some time back ,the show was arid on the action channel at 9pm on
          Monday .PM Modi who is known for his physical fitness and being a
          regular on the yoga mat , stunned million for Indians as he embarked
          on a rare adventure in uttarakhand's jim corbett national park with
          bear grylls in a special episode of man vs wild. The show revealed
          some interesting anecdotes on how PM Modi used to create bathing salts
          from dew as a child ,or his "rendezvous" with wild -life during
          childhood. During the show ,when bear pointed out the dangers lurking
          in their vicinity,PM Modi fearlessly said , "We" should not take this
          place as <br />a danger zone . When we go against nature then<br />
          everything becomes dangerous; human beings too<br />
          become dangerous .
